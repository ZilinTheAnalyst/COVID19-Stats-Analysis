# **COVID19-Stats-Analysis**
## **Project Overview**

This project involves analysing an Excel dataset containing **85,172 records** of COVID-19 statistics from the World Health Organization, including **location data, case counts, vaccination details, and patient health information.** The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my analytical thought processâ€”how I make sense of **real-world raw data**, solve data process problems, extract meaningful insights, and derive conclusions from the available dataset.

## **Objectives**
* Understand the dataset by exploring its structure, key attributes, and potential data quality issues.
* Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.
* Develop insights into COVID-19 trends, such as case surges, vaccination rates, and patient health conditions.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following key columns:
* Location Information: Continent, region, population density, GDP
* COVID-19 Cases: Total cases, new cases, mortality.
* Vaccination Data: Number of vaccinations.
* Patient Health Details: Age, smoking status, diabetes

## **Analysis Approach**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  * Handling missing or inconsistent data. 
  * Standardising date formats and numerical values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  * Summary statistics for key attributes.
  * Identifying trends in cases and vaccination rates.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**
* Excel for initial data inspection and preprocessing.
* Google BigQuery for extracting and analysing data.

## **Key Findings (Summary)**
* Patterns in infection rates based on geographic regions and vaccination rates.
* Effectiveness of vaccinations in reducing mortality rate and new cases increasing rate.

## **Conclusion**
This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with large datasets, clean and analyse data, and extract valuable insights. It also reflects my critical thinking and problem-solving skills during the process.

## **Future Enhancements**
* Apply **machine learning models** to predict case trends and patient outcomes.
* Develop an **interactive dashboard** for COVID-19 insights.
